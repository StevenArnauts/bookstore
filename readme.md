### Intro
This is a demo application to use for demonstrations and try out new things.

### Running
* Requires ProgreSQL 10 (https://www.postgresql.org/download/windows/)
* Check the connection string in appsettings.json. The database and tables will be created automatically.
* To customize settings locally:
  * Don't modify appsettings.json, as you might affect others.
  * Instead, add a file appsettings.json.user, and overwrite anything you want. This file won't be checked in.

### Environments
* Set ASPNETCORE_ENVIRONMENT in launchSettings.json.
* Modify / Create the file appsettings.env.json for that environment


### To Do
* Unit of work? In EF Core disposing the DbContext doesn't seem to trigger SaveChanges any more?
* Add explicit EF mappings (1 per type)
* Split customercontroller (or do it in the training)

## Running on MacOS with PostgreSQL and VS Code

### Install PostgreSQL and Postico
On MacOS, a great and simple PostgreSQL implementation is Postgres.app together with Postico client.
* Download Postgres.app from https://postgresapp.com/downloads.html  
Move to Applications folder and open it.  
Click "Initialize" to create a new server  
You now have a PostgreSQL server running on your Mac with default settings:

Setting | Default
--- | --- 
Host	         |localhost
Port	         |5432
User	         |your system user name
Database	      |same as user
Password	      |none
Connection URL	|postgresql://localhost

* Download Postico from https://eggerapps.at/postico/  
  Move to Applications folder and open it.


#### Prepare database
In Postico, click "+Database" and name it bookstore.  
Open menu Navigate | Go to Terminal.  
Paste the following commands:
```
create user pencil42 with encrypted password 'xxxxxxxx';
grant all privileges on database bookstore to pencil42;
```
Note: Adjust password as necessary (must match the one used in the connection string in appsettings.dev.json)
Note: More fine-grained privileges may be appropriate, to look into.


#### Server
* Make sure you have .Net 2.2 SDK installed.
* Make sure you trust the bookstore ca !!!
* Clone and open project folder in VS Code.
  ```
  git clone https://github.com/StevenArnauts/bookstore.git
  cd bookstore
  code .
  ```
* When asked about unresolved dependencies or required assets to build and debug, click yes :)

* Go to Debug, click Start Debugging (the green arrow), select .Net Core and "Server" project.

* In launch.json, set  
  ``` 
  "ASPNETCORE_ENVIRONMENT": "dev"
  ```

* Click Start Debugging again.  
  This should cause the DB to be initialized and seeded.  
  Go check in Postico.

### Configuration
Launch settings are considered to be a local thing, and are therefore excluded git in .gitignore. However, without Visual Studio
it's convenient to start from an existing file. The launch settings must be in a file called launchSettings.json and must be in a Properties 
subfolder. 
#### Server
Copy the file Configuration\server.json to Server\Properties\launchSettings.json

#### Identity
Copy the file Configuration\identity.json to Identity\Properties\launchSettings.json

#### Running both Identity and Server at the same time
This is a bit complicated :)  
For now, see launch.json.sample and tasks.json.sample - these are copies of the files in .vscode folder.  
Specifically, look at the ASPNETCORE_URLS and the "compoounds" section in launch.json.sample.  
For some background cf e.g. https://elanderson.net/2018/04/run-multiple-projects-in-visual-studio-code/

#### Running any project from the command line.
If debugging more than one project simultaneously is not needed, an alternative approach is to run the project/process 
that you are not debugging from the command line with the following command (executed from the root of the project)
```
dotnet run
```

Use HTTPS urls https://localhost:6101 and https://localhost:6103. VS Code will by default open http://0.0.0.0:6001.
